# Guide for learners - Optiver Ready Trader Go Competition
The [Optiver Ready Trader Go Competition](https://readytradergo.optiver.com) is a student coding competition that gives participants their first look at the world of algorithmic trading. The competition challenges participants to build an automated trading algorithm for a simulated market exchange.

## Why learn it?
The world of algorithmic trading is a high pressured and competitive environment. Large trading firms compete to have the most profitable, most reliable and fastest algorithms that can make them sizable financial returns. This competition will give participants a good understanding of market terminology along with a thorough understanding of the workings of a modern interconnected market. With this knowledge participants will have to test their critical thinking and optimization skills in a competitive environment. By the end of the competition competitors will be in a strong position to enter the world of algorithmic trading having showcased their new skills through there autotrader algorithm.

## What do you need to know before starting?
### Overview
This competition requires a good understanding of the mathematics behind algorithmic trading along with knowledge of common financial terms. Optiver has created a [series of videos](https://readytradergo.optiver.com/learn/?utm_campaign=Global%20RTG%202023&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=249234483&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9a5azHMaWfDldULyec2H4EL-v4-RLC1vJPnBA59grDH2vfjX3a7DRBZNWT64-AFjC0MUBS-EkB805XlIvv5hF6K0WTsw&utm_content=249234483&utm_source=hs_email) that take you through the knowledge required for the competition from the basic terminology of finance to what a market maker is and how to begin to create your own strategy. These videos are password protected and so only available to participants of the competition. This competiton has been designed ot be accessible to complete begineers.

### Market instruments
There are many different market instruments such as Options, Stocks, Futures and ETFs. A successful competitor in this competition will need to understand how these different instruments are priced along with how they relate to each other. For example, buying a lot of a stock will drive up its price and in turn cause its option and future price to also change.

### Order books
When running the Ready Trader Go system you are presented with the order books of an ETF and a Future. An [order book](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp) shows you the buying and selling that is taking place for that instrument. Factors such as buyer interest, seller interest and liquidity must be taken into account when designing your algorithm. Too little liquidity and you canâ€™t execute a trade and could end up stuck with a loss-making position whilst took much liquidity could signal market uncertainty. On the left side of an order book is buyer interest and the right-hand side seller interest. The middle is the price ladder and shows at what price buyers and sellers are trading at.

### Market making
For the competition you are tasked with making a market neutral pairs trading strategy. This is where you determine that two stocks are correlated, meaning that when they diverge away from their long-term correlation you can be confident that they will return to that correlation in the future. Knowing this you can sell the overvalued instrument and buy the undervalued instrument of the pair in the knowladge that they will return to there long term correlation. For the competition you must trade and ETF and Futures pair. A good resource for learning about pairs trading is this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/SpencerPao/Quantitative_Strategies/blob/main/Pairs%20Trading/Overview%20of%20Quantitative%20Strategies.ipynb) created by GitHub user [Spencer Pao](https://github.com/SpencerPao).
![Pairs trading example](/assets/images/pairs-trading-example.png)<br>
A market maker makes a profit by capitalising on the spread that has arisen between two correlated instruments.

### Hedging
In order to remain market neutral whenever you make a trade you need to hedge this trade in the order book of the other correlated instrument. A hedge is the opposite trade to the trade you have just made. If you have just bought 10 * ETF contracts, then you sell 10 * Futures contracts and visaverse. This means that you never have any market exposure and are profiting on the spread between the two instruments. At any given moment your net position in terms of ETF and Futures owned is 0. The Autotrader class provided by Optiver handles this hedging automatically.

### Order types
There are a couple of different order types that you can read about on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/basics-trading-stock-know-your-orders/). You are able to use all these different types of orders in the Optiver competition. Which type of orders that you use will affect the profitability of your system. The most basic type of order is a Market Order where you buy x amount of stock at the best available price. This means your order will stay alive until you have bought the requested volume of stock which leaves you open to market fluctuations. The two order types that are most useful for this competition are Fill-or-kill orders and IOC, immediate or cancel, orders. A fill-or-kill order will only execute if the requested stock can be bought in full at your specified price immediately. Whilst an IOC order will immediately fulfil as much volume at your specific price as possible without going over your requested volume.

### Mathematical analysis
Whilst there are countless ways to implement a pair trading strategy here are some of the key mathematical concepts that will help you to devise a trading strategy of your own. In order to determine if two market instruments are correlated you will have to carry out a cointegration test. It is recommended to make use of the Pandas python library that provides you with the ability to carry out these tests easily. The test that we used for the [Pearson standard correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) which showed the four market data sets were all strongly correlated. Once you are confident a correlation exists you are able to monitor the ratio between the two instruments. By [calculating the current z_score](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zscore.asp#:~:text=Investopedia%20%2F%20Tara%20Anand-,What%20Is%20Z%2DScore%3F,identical%20to%20the%20mean%20score.) of the ratio which represents the relationship of the ratio to the mean of the ratios you can set a threshold that when passed initiates a corresponding buy or sell order. The z_score lets you know when the ratio of the two instruments has diverged sufficiently enough for you to be confident that a profit opportunity exists. With an optimised z_score threshold you should be in a strong position to be making profits.

### Implementing your trading algorithm
Equipped with your new knowledge of financial markets and algorithmic trading theory you are now ready to implement your algorithm. Optiver provides a file called "autotrader.py" which contains the "Autotrader" class. This is where you will implement your algorithm. The key method of this class is the "on_order_book_update_message" which is called every time there is a new price update of the ETF or Future. Inside this class you can write your code to monitor the spread and execute a trade when you enter a situation that you consider to be profitable. To create an order, you use the "send_insert_order" method that takes a couple of parameters such as volume, order type and buy or sell. There is a demo autotrader provided by Optiver that demonstrates executing trades if you need further clarity.

### Optimisation
Once you have implemented your trading algorithm you will want to make sure it is optimised to produce the maximum profits. Optiver have provided four sets of example market data that you can use to train your algorithm. The different market data sets all have different properties and correlations so you will need to ensure your algorithm is effective across the whole range of market conditions. Tweaking the different parameters of your algorithm and monitoring how this effects profitability will help you to find the optimum setup for your strategy.

## Evaluation
Having a good knowledge of how financial markets work along with an implemented trading algorithm is useful for anybody looking to go into finance or the world of algorithmic trading. Having practical knowledge of a markets interconnectedness and having worked to create your own trading algorithm demonstrates a passion and interest in the field and will be useful to anyone aspiring to have a career in the industry. In the real world the opportunities that arise from a pairs trading strategy are very small sometimes only in the order of pennies and last for a fraction of a second. This means that your implemented strategy would most likely perform very poorly outside of the competition simulation. In reality algorithmic trading firms are made up of 100s of mathematicians and programmers who work for years to create profitable strategies with the backing on banks and investors who provide sizable capital. The time taken to learn the skills required for this project are nonetheless valuable as they will enable you to interact with industry professionals and engage in meaningful conversation whislt applying to financial firms. There is an endless list of open-source projects that attempt to explain various pairs trading strategies algorithms and it is recommended that you utilise these when creating your own profitable strategy for the competition.
